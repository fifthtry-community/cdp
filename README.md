# FifthTry-CDP: Common Data Project

At [FifthTry](https://www.fifthtry.com), our mission is complete data and 
software ownership for everything that runs your life. Today we are too 
dependent on companies, who use our dependence on their services to their own 
benefit.

[FifthTry-CDP: Command Data Project](https://cdp.fifthtry.com) aims to put you 
in complete control of your data. This project defines data models and set of 
headless data APIs to interact with that data, so application developers can 
create open data apps, that work with each other, and you remain firmly in 
control of your data.
